Overview
--------

ShiftIt is an application for OSX that allows you to quickly manipulate window position and size using keyboard shortcuts. It intends to become a full featured window organizer for OSX.
This is a sub-fork from the original [ShiftIt][1] by [Aravindkumar Rajendiran][2] which is not longer under development, and builds upon other people's work to add a few things I like, such as one-sixth incremental window sizing and a "large tile" that occupies the left 2/3 of the screen like in some tiling window managers.

Please refer to the [forks](https://github.com/rcarmo/ShiftIt/network) listing for more documentation and related work (kudos to the folk who picked this up before I did).
